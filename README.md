# Chess AI with Minimax Algorithm and Berliner's System

This is a command line interface (CLI) Chess AI that allows you to play against the computer in a game of chess. The AI uses the popular Python Chess module to handle chess-related functionalities and implements the Minimax algorithm to make its decisions. Additionally, it takes into account the relative points according to Berliner's System, which enhances its decision-making process.

## Features

- Play against the computer in a game of chess.
- Set the difficulty level by inputting the depth of calculating future moves.
- The AI evaluates positions using Berliner's System, accounting for the material points as well as the relative points.
- Recursively creates a decision tree containing all possible future positions to determine the best move.
- The AI aims to maximize its advantage while considering that the human player is also trying to maximize their chances of winning.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Python (version 3.6 or higher)
   - Python Chess module (`python-chess`)

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

4. Run the `main.ipynb` script to start the game:

5. Follow the instructions on the screen to input your moves and set the difficulty level.

6. Play the game and try to defeat the AI!

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- Python: The core programming language used for implementing the AI and CLI interface.
- Python Chess module: Used for handling chess rules, board, and move generation.
- Minimax Algorithm: Implemented to recursively create a decision tree and choose the best move for the AI.
- Berliner's System: Employed to evaluate positions based on material points and relative points.
- Command Line Interface: Allows users to interact with the Chess AI from the terminal.
